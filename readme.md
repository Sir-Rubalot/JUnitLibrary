Groupassignment for testing an existing program from our teacher. 
we're making adjustments to the code to adhere to the descriptions. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
This is an application for a library where you can:
Borrow books
Return books

The user may only borrow 1 book per day.
The user may at most have 5 borrowed books at a time.
The user may only borrow one book per title. 
The user may return as many books as he/she wishes per day.
The user may only borrow a book for 7 days straight. 
For every day the book is late, the user has to pay a fine of 20 kr. 
The user can use the extend function to reset the book back to 0 days borrowed, this counts as borrowing 1 book.

LEFT TO RESOLVE:
Days borrowed counter isn't accurate.
After extending a late book, the late fee disappears when you return it. Either: Charge late fee on extension, OR wait to charge until returned.
